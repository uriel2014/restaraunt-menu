# restaraunt-menu

For this project we used internal styling to give the images a certain width and height.

We also provided a lightgrey background to the webpage.

Aside of this we incorporated a navigation list for multiple hmtl files as well as
for bookmarking the id attribures of pupusas, tacos, sopes and desserts.

Nothing aside from this information is needed.
